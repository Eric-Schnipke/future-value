# Fun with Python: Future investment value calculator. #

Idea behind this this code was because I couldn't find a calculator fit with my need. Most calculators out there only allow one fix contribution amount for the course of investment . However, in reality, one can contribute more or less per life's event. I design this one with a flexibility that monthly investment contribution can increase or decrease annually. This is not very user interactive yet but I may plan to do so when I know how T.T

To try out: adjust values in `main()` and hit Run.
